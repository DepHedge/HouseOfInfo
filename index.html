        Shrek was feeling mighty fine,<br>
        He cracked open a cold, crisp Pepsi,<br>
        He took a big gulp, then let out a sigh,<br>
        Ahh, that hit the spot, he said with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was feeling refreshed and renewed,<br>
        His thirst quenched, his spirit imbued,<br>
        He knew that with Pepsi by his side,<br>
        He could take on the world with pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you're feeling tired or down,<br>
        Just crack open a Pepsi, it'll turn your day around,<br>
        It's the drink that refreshes and renews,<br>
        Just like it did for Shrek and his blues.
      </p>
